Idiotmatic-Javascript
=====================

These are guidelines I follow for clean, readable and performant javascript.

**You should:

+ Lint/hint your source code.
+ Minify your source code before pushing to production.
+ Use sourcemaps with your minified files to ease development.

** You should not:

+ Use any shorthand.
    Why? Because shorthand code is not easily legible. It sacrifices readability to save a few bits but since you're minifying your source code, you don't need to worry about saving any bits!
